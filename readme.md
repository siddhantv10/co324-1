# CO324 Pattern Recognition Assignment - 1


<br>
The zip file contains 2 ipynb files which are ipython notebooks and can be opened with jupyter/colab. I have also attached pdfs of these python notebooks. Incase you want to run these codes, kindly download the datasets and place them in the same repository where you extract the zip files. I have not included the datasets along with the codes. Incase you want them included, please let me know.

NOTE: You might find little similarities between my code and two of my classmates whose roll numbers are immediately followed by mine and it is because I helped them with a few segments of the code. Learning python and working of various different libraries takes some time to get used to and definitely cannot be done it two weeks. It is unfair to assume that someone who has no python programming experience/data science knowledge (core branch students) would be able to complete this assignment as good as someone who has been practicing machine learning for a few semesters. Please note that I have not blatantly shared my code for them to copy, instead I have tried to explain the working of every line of the the code to them and I dont mean to instigate you against fairly marking them, but I am sharing this with you in confidence just for your knowledge considering the evaluation of the previous class test.
